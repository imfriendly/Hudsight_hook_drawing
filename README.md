# Hudsight Drawing
Reverse engineered Hudsight's hooks and found a way to render anything to the screen

## How to use
- Add one of the Crosshair image files to Hudsight that fills your screen.
- Configure Hudsight to use Hooks for rendering the crosshair
- Compile & Run the project, and you'll see a rotating square.
